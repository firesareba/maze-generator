# maze-generator
A maze generator! I got this idea from https://youtu.be/uctN47p_KVk?si=w9NsgtNQYqaJRvFC where bro explains origin shift, but I'm gonna try to implement as many algorithms as I can! I also want to display them in a cool way. I also want to be able to solve the mazes, using djikstra(I need the practice).
