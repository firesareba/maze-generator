                <h3>User Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    Use arrow keys to move. There will be a popup once you complete the maze. If maze is too small because of blind mode, zoom in!
                </p>
                <h3>Dropdown</h3>
                <p>
                    Choose the generation method of your maze. 
                    <br><strong>DFS</strong> has long, messy paths that don't turn back a lot with less detours. However, those detours are really long, so it is frustrating.
                    <br><strong>Hunt and Kill</strong> Generally goes down and to the right, Like DFS it has long detours but they are slightly shorter and appear more often.
                    <br><strong>Origin Shift</strong> Many smaller detours, many one cell dead ends. Very few long detours. Most like a childhood maze. It might take a while to generate for bigger mazes(5 sec max).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="right" class="horizontal-child">
                <h3>Slider</h3>
                <p>
                    Choose the size of your maze. Range is from 2x2 to 450x450. Size is in # of cells in a row. Bigger mazes have smaller cells.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Check box to show/hide solution path. Shows OVER blind mode.
                </p>
                <h3>Blind Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    Check box to turn on/off blind mode. Blind mode makes it feel as if user is in a dark maze, holding a torch, so can only see as far as the torch lights up, in a circle.
                </p>
